# connector-wechat-bot
A chatbot based on [wxpy](https://github.com/youfou/wxpy).

It is used for incoming freshmen in group chat, so the main program might not very useful to you, but you can still use the functions implemented in the `messages.py`!



# How to use it?

1. Clone it to your computer 

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/locoda/connector-wechat-bot.git

2. Add your tokens to `api_tokens.py` in the wechat-bot folder

   ```python
   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

   APIAI_TOKEN = 'Your Token'
   TULING_TOKEN = 'Your Token'
   ```

3. Run the bot!

4. Customize your own bot using `messages.py`
